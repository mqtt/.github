MQTT is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices, with a small code footprint and using minimal network bandwidth.

This organization holds [branding](https://github.com/mqtt/mqttorg-graphics) and [source](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.org) for the [MQTT.org website](https://mqtt.org). MQTT is a standard and a specification, and there are many implementations. This GitHub organization is independent of vendors, or project implementations.
